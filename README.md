# BotSpy

Pop open the conversation history of your coding agents.

BotSpy reads the on-disk session histories of **Claude Code, Cursor,
Codex, Grok Bot, and Antigravity** — locally, and read-only. One
adapter per agent, one normalized schema, one local SQLite store with
full-text and semantic search. Everything stays on your machine: no
server, no telemetry, and no writes to your agent data.

## The system in one picture

BotSpy is one local CLI and library on your machine. The coding agents
write their session data to their own local files; BotSpy reads those
files read-only and shows you the results.

## What BotSpy does

- **Reads, never writes.** Each agent's history is read where it lives
  on disk. Live SQLite stores are copied first through a read-only,
  WAL-safe snapshot, so the source file, its WAL, and its shm are never
  touched and the live app never blocks.
- **One normalized schema.** Every record from every agent becomes a
  `Session`, `Message`, and `Part`, with provenance back to the exact
  source file, line, or row. Records an adapter does not know are
  skipped and counted, never fatal.
- **One local store.** One SQLite database at `~/.botspy/store.db`
  (WAL mode) holds sessions, messages, parts, a full-text index (FTS5),
  and a vector index (sqlite-vec, with embeddings from
  all-MiniLM-L6-v2 computed on your CPU).
- **Search three ways.** Full-text search, semantic search, or the
  hybrid fusion of both.
- **One command line over all agents.** `botspy sources`, `doctor`,
  `sessions`, `show`, `snapshot`, and `scan` — a thin shell over the
  library; every verb is one library call plus rendering.
- **Sensitive-data visibility.** BotSpy never hides where session
  content lives. Every architecture diagram marks the sensitive places,
  and [`docs/sensitive-data.md`](https://github.com/DataParade-io/BotSpy/blob/develop/docs/sensitive-data.md)
  lists every path BotSpy reads, copies, or writes.

## How the data flows

Five agents' files feed five source adapters. The adapters convert
their records into the unified schema, ingest writes the store, and the
query surface answers over it — text, semantic, or hybrid. The diagram
shows every source and every exact path.

</picture>

## One machine, one store

On one machine there are four data places and one process: the agent
session files (read-only), temporary snapshot copies for live SQLite
files, the local store at `~/.botspy/store.db`, and a model cache that
holds model weights only, no session data. The BotSpy CLI is the one
process; it holds no data of its own. Delete `~/.botspy/` and no BotSpy
copy of your sessions remains.

## Everything stays local

- Adapters are read-only by construction — the protocol has no surface
  for writing to a source.
- Live SQLite stores in WAL mode are read through snapshot copies; the
  source file, WAL, and shm are never written.
- There is no network, no telemetry, no server. BotSpy reads local
  files and prints local answers; nothing leaves the machine.
- **One honest exception:** semantic search runs a real embedding model
  (quantized all-MiniLM-L6-v2 via ONNX on your CPU). Its weights and
  tokenizer are fetched once — only when you explicitly run the setup
  step (`cargo run --example setup_models`), digest-verified, and
  cached under `~/.botspy/models/` (`BOTSPY_MODELS` overrides the
  location). After that, everything is fully offline.

Both read-only behavior and WAL-safe snapshotting are pinned by
executed specifications:
[`features/03_importers/contract.feature`](https://github.com/DataParade-io/BotSpy/blob/develop/features/03_importers/contract.feature)
and
[`features/03_importers/wal_snapshot.feature`](https://github.com/DataParade-io/BotSpy/blob/develop/features/03_importers/wal_snapshot.feature).

## Supported agents and where their data lives

| Agent | Source name | Reads |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `claude_code` | `~/.claude/projects/` — per-session JSONL transcripts |
| Cursor | `cursor` | `~/.cursor/state.vscdb` and CLI agent transcripts, read through a WAL-safe snapshot copy |
| Codex | `codex` | `~/.codex/sessions/` rollout JSONL plus the thread index at the root |
| Grok Bot | `grok_bot` | `~/.grok/sand-client-persistence/` entry logs, plus roster and cloud-agent files |
| Antigravity | `antigravity` | `~/.gemini/antigravity/` summaries DB, brain transcripts, and payload databases, read through snapshot copies |

Default roots sit under your home directory; `--root` and `--home`
override them. The full inventory of every exact path, in every
category, is in
[`docs/sensitive-data.md`](https://github.com/DataParade-io/BotSpy/blob/develop/docs/sensitive-data.md).

## Install

```bash
cargo install botspy --locked
```

Prerequisites:

- A Rust toolchain — install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs).
- A C compiler: SQLite is bundled and compiled at build time.
  - macOS: Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`)
  - Linux: `build-essential` (Debian/Ubuntu) or your distribution's
    `gcc`/`clang` packages
  - Windows: the Microsoft C++ Build Tools (MSVC)

BotSpy is built and tested on Linux (x86_64 and arm64, glibc and musl),
macOS (Apple Silicon and Intel), and Windows (MSVC).

## Usage

The examples below come from BotSpy's synthetic test corpus (`--home
/tmp/demo` points at fixture agent files). Paths, ids, and titles are
fixtures, not real sessions. Every verb accepts `-o human` (default),
`-o json`, or `-o ndjson`; machine modes never truncate. Add
`--no-truncate` in human mode for full ids and paths.

### See what BotSpy can read

```console
$ botspy sources --home /tmp/demo
SOURCE        ROOT                                        SESSIONS  STATUS
claude_code   /tmp/demo/.claude/projects                  4         ok
cursor        /tmp/demo/.cursor/state.vscdb               2         ok
codex         /tmp/demo/.codex                            2         ok
grok_bot      …mp/demo/.grok/sand-client-persistence      3         ok
antigravity   /tmp/demo/.gemini/antigravity               2         ok
```

A source whose files are missing is listed as `missing`, never hidden.
Restrict to one source with `--source claude_code`; point at a different
home with `--home` (or the `BOTSPY_HOME` environment variable).

### Check the health of your sources

```console
$ botspy doctor --home /tmp/demo
claude_code   ok    3 project dirs, 4 transcripts, 0 issues
cursor        ok    2 composers, 4 bubbles, 0 issues
codex         ok    2 threads, 0 issues
grok_bot      ok    2 entry logs, 1 cloud agents, 0 issues
antigravity   ok    2 conversations, 2 transcripts, 0 issues
```

Doctor reports; it does not gate — skipped files and missing stores are
data about your machine, not failures. The exit code stays `0`. Narrow
it with `botspy doctor --source cursor`.

### List sessions across every agent

```console
$ botspy sessions --home /tmp/demo
SESSION   AGENT         PROJECT               MSGS  LAST ACTIVITY         TITLE

13 sessions (use --no-truncate for full ids)
```

Sessions are ordered by most recent activity. Filters combine:

```console
$ botspy sessions --home /tmp/demo --since 2026-10-01T09:05:00Z
SESSION   AGENT         PROJECT               MSGS  LAST ACTIVITY         TITLE
00000000  claude_code   …ynth-workspace-beta     1  2026-10-01T09:20:00Z  —
00000000  claude_code   …nth-workspace-alpha     1  2026-10-01T09:10:00Z  —
conv-syn  antigravity   corpus sweep             0  2026-10-01T09:05:00Z  —
3 sessions (use --no-truncate for full ids)
```

- `--source <name>` (repeatable), `--project <id>`, `--limit <n>`
- `--since <timestamp>` / `--until <timestamp>` keep only sessions with
  activity in the window (RFC 3339 timestamps)
- `-o json` for the full summaries:

```console
$ botspy sessions --home /tmp/demo --source claude_code -o json
[
  {
    "id": "00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000003",
    "agent": "claude_code",
    "project_id": "-Users-synth-workspace-beta",
    "started_at": "2026-10-01T09:20:00Z",
    "last_activity_at": "2026-10-01T09:20:00Z",
    "message_count": 1,
    "metadata": {}
  },
  …
]
```

### Open one session

```console
$ botspy show --home /tmp/demo solo-abc123
Session solo-abc (claude_code, extra-demo) — 2 messages, started 2026-09-15T12:00:00Z
#1 user 2026-09-15T12:00:00Z
  · text  hello from the fixture
#2 user 2026-09-15T12:05:00Z
  · text  second message
```

A session is addressed by the agent's own stable id, or any unambiguous
prefix. Drill into a single message by its 1-based ordinal:

```console
$ botspy show --home /tmp/demo solo-abc123 --message 2
Session solo-abc (claude_code, extra-demo) — 2 messages, started 2026-09-15T12:00:00Z
#2 user 2026-09-15T12:05:00Z
  · text  second message
```

`-o json` prints the whole session; `-o ndjson` streams one message per
line. An unknown id is an error, never an empty result; an ambiguous
prefix is an error listing the candidates, never a guess.

### WAL-safe snapshot of a SQLite source

```console
$ botspy snapshot --home /tmp/demo cursor
snapshot: /tmp/demo/.botspy/snapshots/cursor/snapshot.db
rows: 8
source unmutated (digest verified before/after)
```

The positional argument is a source name or a path to a SQLite database.
Use `--out <dir>` to override where the copy lands (default:
`<home>/.botspy/snapshots/<source>/snapshot.db`).

### Mine the adapters into the local store

`botspy scan` runs a CDC pass into `<home>/.botspy/store.db` (override
with `--store <path>`). Pruning is off — a source that reports nothing
never deletes stored history. For scripts and CI, run exactly one pass
with `--once`:

```console
$ botspy scan --home /tmp/demo --once --store /tmp/demo/.botspy/store.db
store  /tmp/demo/.botspy/store.db
SOURCE        ADDED  UPDATED  UNCHANGED  SKIPPED  ERRORS  MESSAGES
claude_code       4        0          0        0       0  +8
cursor            2        0          0        0       0  +4
codex             2        0          0        0       0  +7
grok_bot          2        0          0        0       1  +5
antigravity       2        0          0        0       0  +8
scanned 5 sources in 0.0s: 12 added, 0 updated, 0 unchanged, 0 skipped, 1 errors
```

Without `--once`, scan keeps running: it re-scans every
`--interval <SECONDS>` seconds (default `60`, measured from the end of
the previous pass so passes never overlap) until interrupted. SIGINT lets
the current pass finish and commit, then exits with code `130`.

```console
$ botspy scan --home /tmp/demo --interval 1
pass 1
store  /tmp/demo/.botspy/store.db
SOURCE        ADDED  UPDATED  UNCHANGED  SKIPPED  ERRORS  MESSAGES
claude_code       4        0          0        0       0  +8
…
scanned 5 sources in 0.0s: 12 added, 0 updated, 0 unchanged, 0 skipped, 1 errors
pass 2
store  /tmp/demo/.botspy/store.db
SOURCE        ADDED  UPDATED  UNCHANGED  SKIPPED  ERRORS  MESSAGES
claude_code       0        0          4        0       0  0
…
```

`--since` accepts an RFC 3339 timestamp, an ISO date (`YYYY-MM-DD`), or a
relative duration like `7d` / `24h`. `--dry-run` reports what would
change without writing.

### Store-backed verbs (planned)

`search`, `import`, `stats`, and `watch` are specified and tracked on
the board but not shipped in `0.2.0` yet. They will query and refresh the
local store at `~/.botspy/store.db`. See
[`docs/cli.md`](https://github.com/DataParade-io/BotSpy/blob/develop/docs/cli.md)
for the planned flags and output shapes.

### Pipe and compose

```bash
botspy sessions -o ndjson | jq -r .project_id | sort | uniq -c
botspy show solo-abc -o ndjson | jq -c 'select(.role=="assistant")'
botspy sources -o json | jq -r '.[] | select(.status != "ok") | .name'
```

## The library: one local store, searchable

As a library, BotSpy keeps everything it ingests in one local SQLite
store (WAL mode, with the sqlite-vec extension) at
`~/.botspy/store.db` (`BOTSPY_HOME` moves it). You register the
read-only adapters, ingest their sessions, and query through one
interface:

- iteration over sessions, messages, and parts in order, with filters
  by source, project, part kind, and time window pushed down to SQLite;
- FTS5 text search, ranked and filter-composable;
- semantic search over all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embeddings (computed on your
  CPU, after the one-time `cargo run --example setup_models` fetch),
  with a relevance floor so noise never ranks;
- hybrid search that fuses the lexical and semantic halves.

Incremental refresh keeps the store in step with the sources without
re-mining everything. The behavior is pinned by the executable specs
under
[`features/02_querying/`](https://github.com/DataParade-io/BotSpy/blob/develop/features/02_querying/)
and the store chapter in
[`docs/store.md`](https://github.com/DataParade-io/BotSpy/blob/develop/docs/store.md).
